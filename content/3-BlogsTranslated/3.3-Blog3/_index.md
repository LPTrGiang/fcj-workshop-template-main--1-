## Introducing AWS Builder Center: A New Home for the AWS Builder Community

**Authors: Channy Yun and Matheus Guimaraes — July 9, 2025**  
*Voiced by AWS Polly*

We truly value the builders at AWS. We constantly think of new ways to help technical communities grow, and to create spaces such as the **AWS Developer Center** and **community.aws**, where people can connect and share knowledge and experiences.

Today, we are announcing the **AWS Builder Center**, a new home for builders to access all related resources, engage with the AWS community, and contribute feedback or product suggestions to AWS product teams. This new experience also combines both the previous AWS Developer Center and community.aws.

## Key Features

### Your voice matters: Introducing the **Wishlist**

One of the most exciting new features, in my opinion, is the Wishlist. You can now submit your wishes for new features or improvements you want to see in AWS services. Others can explore and vote for these wishes, or create their own Wishlists.

You can influence the product roadmap together with the community and help us shape the future of AWS services. You can share ideas, feature proposals, suggestions, or challenges you face while operating AWS services—allowing the AWS community to vote and highlight the most desired improvements.

## Connecting everyone in the AWS community

On the **Connect** page, you will find many opportunities to engage directly with **AWS Heroes** and **AWS Community Builders**. You can also discover and join **AWS User Groups** and **AWS Cloud Clubs** in cities near you around the world.

Additionally, you can bookmark this page as a central place to find upcoming community events, making it easier to explore learning and networking opportunities in your region.

The AWS Builder Center also helps you easily connect and interact with others. The **Who to Follow** section introduces AWS Heroes, Community Builders, and active community members who are sharing knowledge and expertise in areas you care about.

## Explore hands-on AWS resources

On the **Build** page, you will discover:

- AWS Tutorials  
- AWS Workshops  
- AI playgrounds (Generative AI & Agentic AI)  
- AWS Free Tier  
- Toolbox: tools, programming languages, open-source projects  

The Toolbox provides everything you need to start a project and take it to production.

- Themed groups

## Supporting your builder journey

The **Learn** section serves as a gateway to developing AWS skills. Here, you can explore:

You will also see **featured** and **trending topics** to help you stay updated on community trends.

## Built-in localization for your language

AWS Builder Center helps you:

- create a personalized profile  
- set a custom URL  
- share a QR code  
- manage posts, wishlists, and interactions
