A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”\nThis solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post. The scope is still limited to the ingestion and basic parsing of HL7v2 messages formatted in Encoding Rules 7 (ER7) through a REST interface.\nThe solution architecture is now as follows:\nFigure 1. Overall architecture; colored boxes represent distinct services.\nWhile the term microservices has some inherent ambiguity, certain traits are common:\nSmall, autonomous, loosely coupled Reusable, communicating through well-defined interfaces Specialized to do one thing well Often implemented in an event-driven architecture When determining where to draw boundaries between microservices, consider:\nIntrinsic: technology used, performance, reliability, scalability Extrinsic: dependent functionality, rate of change, reusability Human: team ownership, managing cognitive load Technology Choices and Communication Scope Communication scope Technologies / patterns to consider Within a single microservice Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Step Functions Between microservices in a single service AWS CloudFormation cross-stack references, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) Between services Amazon EventBridge, AWS Cloud Map, Amazon API Gateway The Pub/Sub Hub Using a hub-and-spoke architecture (or message broker) works well with a small number of tightly related microservices.\nEach microservice depends only on the hub Inter-microservice connections are limited to the contents of the published message Reduces the number of synchronous calls since pub/sub is a one-way asynchronous push Drawback: coordination and monitoring are needed to avoid microservices processing the wrong message.\nCore Microservice Provides foundational data and communication layer, including:\nAmazon S3 bucket for data Amazon DynamoDB for data catalog AWS Lambda to write messages into the data lake and catalog Amazon SNS topic as the hub Amazon S3 bucket for artifacts such as Lambda code Only allow indirect write access to the data lake through a Lambda function → ensures consistency.\nFront Door Microservice Provides an API Gateway for external REST interaction Authentication \u0026amp; authorization based on OIDC via Amazon Cognito Self-managed deduplication mechanism using DynamoDB instead of SNS FIFO because: SNS deduplication TTL is only 5 minutes SNS FIFO requires SQS FIFO Ability to proactively notify the sender that the message is a duplicate Staging ER7 Microservice Lambda “trigger” subscribed to the pub/sub hub, filtering messages by attribute Step Functions Express Workflow to convert ER7 → JSON Two Lambdas: Fix ER7 formatting (newline, carriage return) Parsing logic Result or error is pushed back into the pub/sub hub New Features in the Solution 1.

From the 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare to widespread provider–payer disruptions affecting patient access, the pressure to transform is stronger than ever.\nEmerging technologies—especially generative AI (GenAI) and cloud computing—offer new ways to revolutionize patient care while improving operational efficiency and strengthening security frameworks.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) and third-party solutions available through AWS Marketplace equip HCOs with modern tools to:\nEnhance data security Accelerate AI adoption Streamline clinical and administrative workflows Improve patient outcomes I recently moderated a panel discussion titled “Enabling Digital Transformation to Advance Healthcare,” where leaders explored how organizations can navigate uncertainty while embracing new technologies. The conversation incorporated insights from Forrester’s latest survey of 441 U.S. healthcare organizations, examining cloud infrastructure strategies, GenAI adoption, security, and compliance.\nOur panel included:\nShannon Germain Farraher, Senior Analyst, Forrester Demetri Giannikopoulos, Director of Transformation, Aidoc Dr. Dan Rafter, SVP Partnerships and Product Strategy, Flywheel Wilson To, VP Strategy, Philips This post highlights the key insights shared during our discussion.\n🔍 Key Findings from the Forrester Research Forrester’s study identified four critical focus areas driving digital transformation initiatives across healthcare organizations.\n1. Security takes center stage 92% of respondents ranked improving enterprise security and reducing risk as their top priority. According to the FBI, healthcare was the most targeted industry in 2023. “For hackers, it\u0026rsquo;s low-hanging fruit—there are so many unprotected points of entry.” — Farraher\n2. Data and analytics power AI initiatives A robust data foundation is essential for successful AI.\n44% cited security concerns as their top infrastructure challenge. Poor data hygiene limits the value of GenAI. “If you don’t have a strong data foundation, any fancy GenAI sitting on top won’t help.”\n3. Workforce experience drives investment decisions 90% of organizations plan to increase tech infrastructure spending by at least 10% this year. 83% expect revenue improvements. 79% anticipate improved workforce engagement and experience. 4. GenAI adoption is rapidly maturing 20% of organizations are already at the enterprise or scaling stage. This number is expected to reach 90% within three years. Key use cases include:\nWorkflow optimization (56%) Data integration and analytics Personalized care treatment pathways Converging Forces Accelerating Healthcare Transformation Unlike previous healthcare innovation cycles, several forces are converging to accelerate change today:\nEvolving regulations (FHIR, interoperability) Recent policy updates increasingly reference the need for interoperable healthcare data.\nA culture of rapid innovation post-pandemic The pandemic proved that healthcare can innovate quickly under pressure.\nOrganic demand for GenAI integration GenAI has become mainstream.\n“People use generative AI every day—it has become part of their workflow.” — Farraher\nThis trend contrasts sharply with previous technologies like EHR systems that required extensive training.\nStrategic Approaches to AI Deployment Healthcare organizations are taking a balanced, pragmatic approach to GenAI:\nAutomation to reduce administrative burden Augmentation to enhance clinical capabilities Rapid insight generation to support care delivery “There are so many moments that can be saved—customers want to see how we can deploy technology on behalf of their clinicians.”\nSuccessful deployment requires:\nClear initial use cases Learning from industry peers Comprehensive workflows Strong change management alongside technology adoption “Start with the right use cases. Learn from others. Develop a full end-to-end process.” — Giannikopoulos\nOvercoming Data and Infrastructure Barriers Data standardization is the biggest obstacle Organizations spend up to 85% of their time locating, de-identifying, and preparing data before analysis.\n“It’s a fully manual process without the right tools.” — Dr. Rafter\nShift from departmental tools to enterprise platforms Breaking down data silos Improving interoperability Enabling precision medicine (genomics + imaging + EHR) Cloud infrastructure is no longer optional “It’s no longer a question of whether we should centralize data beyond hospital walls—it must happen.” — Dr. Rafter\nSecurity and Compliance Strategies Healthcare organizations leverage the shared responsibility model, dividing security obligations across:\nInternal teams Cloud service providers Solution vendors Core principles include:\nSecurity by design Alignment with ISO, SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA Clear documentation \u0026amp; transparent accountability “Security is priority zero. Patient safety is at the center of everything.”\nFour Strategic Recommendations for Navigating Digital Transformation Forrester identified four key recommendations for HCOs:\n1. Advocate for unified AI governance frameworks Leverage organizations like CHAI (Coalition for Health AI).\n2. Harness the momentum of Bring-Your-Own-AI (BYOAI) Over 20% of clinicians already use AI tools in their workflows.\nGuide staff toward approved, secure tools rather than punitive measures.\n3. Ground decisions in core organizational values Continue investments in:\nWorkforce recognition Mission alignment Employee autonomy “Recognition shouldn’t be the first thing cut—rather, the last.”\n4. Choose partners that align with your values Partners should provide:\nFlexibility Cost efficiency Minimal disruption Long-term support “Challenge your partners—ensure they meet your needs today and tomorrow.”\n🧾 Conclusion Healthcare is at a pivotal transformational moment. The question is no longer whether to adopt AI and cloud, but how to implement them safely and at scale.\nOrganizations that thrive will:\nPrioritize security Elevate workforce experience Build strong strategic partnerships Stay true to patient-centered missions “Behind every pixel, behind every bit and byte, is a patient.” — Wilson To\nThe next few years will distinguish organizations that lead from those that merely survive.\nAbout AWS Marketplace AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog offering a wide range of healthcare solutions. It enables organizations to:\nDiscover, purchase, and deploy solutions quickly Benefit from flexible pricing and contracting models Shorten procurement and deployment time by up to 50% (Forrester) Over 300,000 organizations use AWS Marketplace monthly to accelerate digital transformation.\nNext Steps Explore healthcare solutions from Philips, Aidoc, and Flywheel on AWS Marketplace Watch the replay of “Enabling Digital Transformation to Advance Healthcare” for deeper insights "},{"uri":"https://lptrgiang.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main--1-/2-proposal/","title":"Proposal","tags":[],"description":"","content":"SportShop E-Commerce Platform A Cost-Optimized AWS Three-Tier Architecture for Online Sports Retail 1. Executive Summary The SportShop E-Commerce Platform is designed to modernize online retail operations using a simplified and cost-optimized AWS architecture, suitable for student projects and small-scale applications. The system uses ReactJS for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and Amazon RDS MySQL for persistent data storage.\nTo reduce cost and complexity, the architecture removes Amazon Cognito, the Application Load Balancer (ALB), NAT Gateway, and banking payment integration. User authentication is handled directly by the backend, which runs on Elastic Beanstalk single-instance mode, while static content is delivered through S3 + CloudFront.\nDespite being simplified, the architecture still follows AWS best practices for security and CI/CD using ACM, Parameter Store, CloudWatch, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild.\n2. Problem Statement Current Problems Slow, manual, and inconsistent deployment workflows Risk of leaked or improperly stored credentials Limited system monitoring and alerting High chance of downtime during updates Proposed Solution The platform leverages AWS managed services to automate deployments, enhance security, and implement a clean three-layer architecture:\nEdge: Route 53, CloudFront (ACM) Application: Elastic Beanstalk (single-instance) Data: RDS MySQL, S3, CloudWatch Secrets such as database credentials and JWT signing keys are securely stored in Parameter Store.\nCI/CD is managed through GitLab → CodePipeline → CodeBuild.\nBenefits Lower AWS cost and reduced architectural complexity Faster deployments through automation Global HTTPS delivery through CloudFront Clear separation between frontend, backend, and database layers 3. Solution Architecture AWS Services Used Amazon Route 53 — DNS Amazon CloudFront — CDN and HTTPS distribution AWS Certificate Manager — SSL/TLS certificates Elastic Beanstalk (Single Instance) — Backend hosting Amazon RDS MySQL — Main database Amazon S3 — Static hosting \u0026amp; media storage Parameter Store — Secure secret management CloudWatch — Logs and metrics CodePipeline + CodeBuild — CI/CD automation Layered Architecture Edge Layer\nRoute 53 → CloudFront CloudFront serves the ReactJS frontend globally over HTTPS Application Layer\nSpring Boot backend deployed on Elastic Beanstalk single-instance Authentication handled with JWT Secure configuration loaded from Parameter Store Data Layer\nRDS MySQL stores structured application data S3 stores static content and media files CloudWatch provides centralized monitoring 4. Technical Implementation Configure VPC, subnets, and security groups Host frontend on S3 + CloudFront Deploy backend with Elastic Beanstalk Provision RDS MySQL Store secrets in Parameter Store CI/CD pipeline: GitLab → CodePipeline → CodeBuild Enable monitoring via CloudWatch Tech Stack:\nFrontend: ReactJS (S3 + CloudFront) Backend: Spring Boot (Java 17) Database: Amazon RDS MySQL CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild Security: IAM, ACM, Parameter Store, CloudWatch 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Month 1 Set up AWS environment (VPC, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route 53) Deploy backend \u0026amp; frontend Configure CI/CD pipeline Month 2 Implement JWT authentication Develop modules: product, order, user management Set up monitoring \u0026amp; alerting Month 3 Testing and optimization Final deployment Documentation and training 6. Budget Estimation You can see the cost on the AWS Pricing Calculator Or download the budget estimate file.\nAWS Service Monthly Cost Amazon RDS MySQL $21.84 Elastic Beanstalk (EC2 t3.micro) $11.68 Amazon S3 $0.26 Data Transfer $0.60 CloudFront $0.88 Route 53 $0.90 ACM Public Certificate $0 CloudWatch Metrics $3.02 CodePipeline $0 CodeBuild $0.50 Parameter Store $0 CloudWatch Logs $1.41 Estimated total: ~$35–40 per month\nYearly: ~$420–480\n7. Risk Assessment Risks Single-instance backend → No fault tolerance No NAT Gateway → Backend cannot call external APIs Risk of JWT token misuse without proper security Mitigation Enable Elastic Beanstalk auto-recovery and health checks Apply secure authentication \u0026amp; token handling practices Utilize RDS automated backups and snapshots 8. Future Enhancements Amazon Cognito — MFA, OAuth, Social Login Application Load Balancer — Multi-instance scaling \u0026amp; high availability NAT Gateway — Allow backend to call external APIs Payment Integrations: VNPay, Stripe, PayPal RDS Multi-AZ — High availability and automatic failover S3 Lifecycle + Glacier — Cost-optimized long-term storage AWS X-Ray + OpenSearch — Tracing and advanced logging Microservices Architecture with ECS/EKS — Scale backend into multiple services "},{"uri":"https://lptrgiang.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main--1-/1-worklog/1.2-week2/","title":"Week 2 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 2 Objectives: Get familiar with basic AWS Services.

Explain how AWS WAF operates, how to design effective rule groups, and how to mitigate false positives. Demonstrate AWS WAF Bot Control for identifying and blocking malicious automation. Introduce AWS Shield’s DDoS defense layers and recent enhancements such as bundled flat-rate pricing. Help attendees understand how to build a layered protection model using Route 53, CloudFront, WAF, and Shield. Speakers AWS Security Specialists – experts focused on application and network security (names not disclosed in the provided materials). Key Highlights Understanding modern internet threats Public endpoints expose applications to high-frequency attacks that may cause downtime, cost spikes, and compliance issues. Consequences include increased infrastructure consumption, data leakage, credential stuffing, and degraded customer trust. Threat categories include: DoS/DDoS attacks across L3/L4 infrastructure and L7 application traffic. Application-level vulnerabilities, including common CVEs and OWASP Top 10 patterns. Bot activities, from scraping to credential abuse, with rapid growth in AI-powered bots (e.g., GPT, Claude, Meta AI). Escalating attack trends Recent data shows a continual rise in DDoS frequency year over year. AI-based clients significantly increase automated and unpredictable traffic patterns. Timelines from 2021–2025 illustrate more frequent and more sophisticated attack behavior. Architecture \u0026amp; Protection Strategies Reinforcing perimeter security using AWS services Amazon Route 53: Resilient DNS with global redundancy and built-in DDoS protections. Amazon CloudFront: Acts as a reverse proxy, terminating TLS at edge PoPs. Blocks attacks early at the edge and reduces backend load. Supports private VPC origin mode to hide ALB/EC2 from the public internet. AWS Shield (Standard \u0026amp; Advanced) Shield provides network-layer filtering, SYN/UDP protection, and health-based traffic mitigation. Shield Advanced adds: Automated L7 rule creation Cost protection against scaling surges during attacks Support from the Shield Response Team (SRT) New CloudFront Flat-Rate Bundles Fixed monthly pricing tiers (Free, Pro, Business, Premium), each bundling CDN + WAF + DDoS + DNS + logging + edge compute. Enables predictable budgeting, eliminates surprise bills from unexpected traffic spikes. Attack traffic (WAF-blocked or DDoS) does not count toward usage quotas. AWS WAF Deep Dive How WAF works Web ACLs combine rules, priority ordering, managed rule groups, and default actions. Supports multiple actions: Allow, Block, Challenge, CAPTCHA, Count. Rate-based rules throttle excessive traffic by IP or custom keys. Labels allow rule chaining, exclusions, and contextual decisions. Recommended rule hierarchy IP allowlists/blocklists Anti-DDoS managed rules Rate-based limits Anonymous/verified client checks Core OWASP/CVE protections Bot and fraud detection Custom business rules (start in Count mode) Bot Control mechanisms Recognizes benign vs. malicious bots using IP reputation, user agents, TLS fingerprints, browser checks, and telemetry. Detects anomalies like token reuse, multi-IP hopping, or automation signatures. Supports challenges (JS/Challenge/CAPTCHA) before enforcing block rules. Key Takeaways Security Mindset Treat internet exposure as a primary risk factor needing a layered, defense-in-depth approach. Start with traffic observations (Count mode) before tightening enforcement. Combine L3/L4 infrastructure defenses with granular L7 application firewalls. Technical Architecture CloudFront as the first line of defense reduces compute and bandwidth cost. Use WAF labels, scoped-down rules, and managed groups to maintain precision. Apply bot interrogation techniques for high-value endpoints like login or checkout.
